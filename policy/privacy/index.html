  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 4, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Talk to Notion</strong> allows users to interact with their Notion workspace using voice or text, enabling quick actions like querying data or adding tasks naturally.</p>

  <h2>What Data We Access</h2>
  <p>To function, we temporarily access your Notion content via the official Notion API. This includes page titles, databases, tasks, and block content as required for your request.</p>

  <h2>What Data We Store</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not store or retain any Notion data.</strong> All data is accessed on-demand, processed in memory, and never saved to our servers or third-party services.</p>

  <h2>How We Use the Data</h2>
  <p>Accessed data is only used to fulfill your request—whether it’s answering a question, updating a task, or performing a Notion operation.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>All interactions with Notion are secured via OAuth and encrypted HTTPS. Your credentials and content are never exposed or shared.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>No third parties have access to your data. Everything stays between you and Notion, via our secure interface.</p>
